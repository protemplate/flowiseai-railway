## üìù Notes
Use the flowise-railway template (https://railway.app/template/pn4G8S) if you don't need pre-configured persisted volume, postgis and private networking on Railway.

# Deploy Flowise with Railway (Shared PostGIS Instance)

## ‚ú® Features
- Pre-configured persisted volume.
- Most of the Flowise configs are pre-configured.
- Uses shared Postgres/PostGIS instance (perfect for n8n + Flowise setup).
- Automatic database initialization on first deployment.
- The communication from Flowise to database is accomplished through the railway internal private network, reducing unnecessary egress fees.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisite
- Postgres or PostGIS is already deployed to an environment on Railway (e.g., shared with n8n)
- Flowise and Postgres have to be deployed to the same environment in order to leverage the benefits of private networking on Railway.
- The PostGIS instance should have the main database (e.g., `railway`) already created
- The `flowise` database will be automatically created on first deployment

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/A7Dwg9?referralCode=OYCuBb)

### üöÄ Quick start

1. Click Deploy Now

2. Change to your preferred repository name

3. Click Configure and click Save Config for both services.

4. Click Deploy.

5. Let Railway deploy all the services for you.

6. Once the process is successful, you will be able to view a deployed URL.


### üí° Integration with existing n8n + PostGIS setup

If you already have n8n running with PostGIS on Railway, you can add Flowise to share the same database instance:

1. Deploy this Flowise template to the **same Railway environment** as your PostGIS database

2. Configure the following environment variables in Railway:

- `DATABASE_HOST`: Use `${{RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` from your PostGIS service
- `DATABASE_NAME`: `flowise` (will be created automatically)
- `DATABASE_USER`: `${{POSTGRES_USER}}` (from your PostGIS service)
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: `${{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}}` (from your PostGIS service)
- `DATABASE_PORT`: `5432`
- `DATABASE_TYPE`: `postgres`
- `DATABASE_SSL`: `true`
- `POSTGRES_DB`: `${{POSTGRES_DB}}` (the main database, e.g., `railway`)

3. The initialization script will automatically:
   - Connect to your existing PostGIS instance
   - Create the `flowise` database if it doesn't exist
   - Start Flowise with the new database

4. Both n8n and Flowise will use the same PostGIS instance but with separate databases

## üö¶ Queue Mode Configuration

Flowise supports queue mode for handling large numbers of predictions. This allows you to separate job submission from job execution and scale workers dynamically.

### Prerequisites for Queue Mode

1. **Shared Encryption Key**: All Flowise instances (main and workers) must use the same encryption key
2. **Redis Service**: Deploy Redis in the same Railway environment
3. **Database**: All instances share the same PostgreSQL database

### Clean Setup Process (Recommended)

To avoid encryption and data corruption issues, follow this order:

1. **First, set up all environment variables** on both main and worker services
2. **Generate a secure encryption key** (32+ characters)
3. **Deploy Redis** to your Railway environment
4. **Configure main server** with all required variables INCLUDING `FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE`
5. **Configure worker(s)** with identical encryption key
6. **Deploy all services**
7. **Only then create flows and credentials**

### Railway Deployment with Queue Mode

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Setup Requirements**:
> 1. **Set FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE on ALL instances BEFORE first deployment**
> 2. **The encryption key must be IDENTICAL across main server and all workers**
> 3. **Railway's private networking requires IPv6 support - use `?family=0` in Redis URL**

1. **Add Redis to your Railway environment:**
   - Go to your Railway project dashboard
   - Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "Add Redis"
   - Deploy Redis to the **same environment** as Flowise
   - Once deployed, click on the Redis service
   - Go to the "Variables" tab
   - Copy the `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` value (it will be something like `redis-production-xxxx.railway.internal`)
   - Copy the `REDISPASSWORD` value if authentication is enabled

2. **Configure Flowise main server (job submission):**
   - In your Flowise service, go to the Variables tab
   - Add these environment variables:
   ```env
   # MUST be set BEFORE creating any credentials or flows
   FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE=your-32-character-secret-key-here
   
   # Queue configuration
   MODE=queue
   QUEUE_NAME=flowise-queue
   REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_PRIVATE_URL}}?family=0
   ```
   
   **Important notes:**
   - Generate a secure 32+ character encryption key
   - Set this BEFORE creating any flows or credentials
   - Replace `Redis` with your actual Redis service name if different
   - The `?family=0` parameter is required for BullMQ/ioredis IPv6 compatibility

3. **Deploy Flowise worker(s):**
   - Deploy another instance of this Flowise template
   - Set the same Redis configuration as above
   - Set `MODE=worker` instead of `MODE=queue`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Add the same encryption key as the main server:
     ```env
     FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE=<your-encryption-key>
     ```
   - The encryption key must be identical across all instances (main and workers)
   - You can deploy multiple workers for parallel processing

   **Note**: Workers need the same encryption key to decrypt credentials. Either:
   - Set `FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE` with the same value on all instances, or
   - Mount a shared volume (not recommended on Railway due to complexity)

### Troubleshooting Queue Mode

**"Malformed UTF-8 data" error**:
- This means the worker's encryption key doesn't match the main server's
- Solution: Ensure `FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE` is identical on all instances
- If you already have data, you'll need to either:
  - Export flows/credentials, set the same key everywhere, and re-import
  - Find the auto-generated key from the main server logs

**"ENOTFOUND redis.railway.internal" error**:
- The Redis URL needs `?family=0` appended for IPv6 support
- Ensure Redis is deployed in the same Railway environment
- Use `${{Redis.REDIS_PRIVATE_URL}}?family=0` format

**"ENOENT: no such file or directory" error**:
- Worker can't find encryption key file
- Solution: Set `FLOWISE_SECRETKEY_OVERWRITE` on the worker

**"ZodError: nodes/edges Required" error**:
- This indicates corrupted or incomplete flow data
- Often caused by encryption key mismatches corrupting the data
- Solutions:
  1. Clear Redis queue: Connect to Redis and run `FLUSHDB`
  2. Ensure all instances use the same encryption key
  3. Recreate flows after fixing encryption keys
  4. Check that main server and workers are running the same Flowise version

### Local Development with Queue Mode

1. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   MODE=queue
   QUEUE_NAME=flowise-queue
   REDIS_HOST=redis
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   WORKER_CONCURRENCY=10000
   ```

2. **Start services with docker-compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **To add a worker container**, create a new service in `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   flowise-worker:
       build: .
       restart: always
       depends_on:
           postgis:
               condition: service_healthy
           redis:
               condition: service_healthy
       environment:
           - MODE=worker
           - WORKER_CONCURRENCY=10000
           # ... (copy other env vars from flowise service)
       volumes:
           - ~/.flowise:/root/.flowise
   ```

### Queue Configuration Options

- `MODE`: Set to `queue` for main server or `worker` for worker instances
- `QUEUE_NAME`: Name of the queue (default: `flowise-queue`)
- `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`: Number of parallel jobs per worker (default: 10000)
- `REMOVE_ON_AGE`: Remove completed jobs after X seconds (default: 86400 = 24 hours)
- `REMOVE_ON_COUNT`: Keep maximum X completed jobs (default: 10000)
- `ENABLE_BULLMQ_DASHBOARD`: Enable BullMQ dashboard for monitoring (default: false)

2. Pass `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```
    environment:
        - PORT=${PORT}
        - FLOWISE_USERNAME=${FLOWISE_USERNAME}
